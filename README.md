## About this fork

This repository is a fork of [gonzalezreal/textual](https://github.com/gonzalezreal/textual) that has
diverged significantly from upstream. The divergence lies in three areas:

- **New features** — GitHub-flavored Markdown task lists rendered as checkboxes with customizable
  markers, custom text run effects drawn behind or in front of the glyphs through the `TextRunEffect`
  protocol, and a synchronous syntax highlighting mode for offscreen rendering such as `ImageRenderer`
  or PDF export.
- **Streaming performance** — a series of optimizations for re-rendering markup that streams in
  incrementally: memoized block decomposition and inline feature scans, throttled re-parsing of
  streamed markup changes, a token cache shared by both code tokenizers, adopting new layout origins
  instead of rebuilding the layout collection, dictionary-based layout index lookups, and hashing
  images by their first frame's identity. Renderer benchmarks with before/after results live in
  [`TEXTUAL_PERF.md`](./TEXTUAL_PERF.md).
- **Fixes** — list item spacing reacts to environment changes, and escaped task list markers stay
  literal instead of turning into checkboxes.

The rest of this README documents the fork as it stands. The badges above and the documentation and
installation links below still point at the upstream project and do not reflect the changes listed
here.

## Overview

**Textual** is the spiritual successor to [MarkdownUI](https://github.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui), reimagined
from the ground up to address the lessons learned from community feedback. While MarkdownUI focuses on Markdown
rendering, Textual is designed as a SwiftUI text rendering engine that happens to support Markdown. This shift in
perspective influenced every design decision.

Textual preserves SwiftUI's `Text` rendering pipeline so you can get performance, composability, and automatic
platform adaptations. The rendering flow transforms markup into attributed content, resolves attachments asynchronously,
applies styling through environment values, and uses SwiftUI's layout system to position everything.

### Key features

- **Specialized views** with `InlineText` for inline-formatted text and `StructuredText` for block-based documents
- **Native text selection** with proper copy-paste support
- **Markdown support** via Foundation's `AttributedString` built-in parser
- **Custom markup parser support** through the `MarkupParser` protocol
- **Inline attachments** that flow with the text, such as images and custom emoji
- **Math expressions** rendered as inline or block attachments
- **Animated image support** (GIF, APNG, WebP)
- **Syntax highlighting** with customizable themes, including a synchronous mode for offscreen rendering
- **Task lists** rendered as checkboxes, with a customizable marker
- **Custom text run effects** drawn behind or in front of the glyphs with `GraphicsContext`
- **Comprehensive styling** for headings, code blocks, tables, links, lists, and more
- **Font-relative** layout measurements that scale with text size and accessibility settings

## Getting started

For inline content with formatting, images, and links, use `InlineText`:

```swift
InlineText(
  markdown: """
    This is a *lighthearted* but **perfectly serious** paragraph where `inline code` lives \
    happily alongside ~~a terrible idea~~ a better one, a [useful link](https://example.com), \
    and a bit of _extra emphasis_ just for style. To keep things interesting without overdoing \
    it, here’s a completely random image that adapts to the container width:

    ![Random image](https://picsum.photos/seed/textual/400/250)
    """
)
```

This creates a view that renders formatted text and flows naturally within its container. `InlineText` is a drop-in
replacement for SwiftUI's `Text` with attachment support and comprehensive styling.

You can customize `InlineText` with standard SwiftUI modifiers (like `.font()` and `.foregroundStyle()`) or use
Textual's inline styling system:

```swift
InlineText(
  markdown: "Use `git status` to check _uncommitted changes_"
)
.font(.custom("Avenir Next", size: 18))
.textual.inlineStyle(
  InlineStyle()
    .code(
      .monospaced,
      .fontScale(0.85),
      .backgroundColor(.purple),
      .foregroundColor(.white)
    )
    .emphasis(.italic, .underlineStyle(.single))
)
```

For structured content with headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, and tables, use `StructuredText`:

```swift
StructuredText(
  markdown: """
    ## The Problem

    > After merging PR #347, users reported that tapping "Back" from the detail view would sometimes
    > navigate to a completely random screen. One user ended up in Settings while trying to return to
    > their inbox. Another saw the onboarding flow. Creative, but not ideal.

    Here's what we knew going in:

    - The issue only appeared **after** the state restoration changes
    - It happened _inconsistently_—maybe 1 in 5 back navigations
    - The stack trace was... let's call it "unhelpful"
    """
)
```

This renders a heading, a blockquote, a paragraph, and a bulleted list with appropriate spacing and styling. Each
block can be customized independently.

### The `MarkupParser` protocol

Textual ships with Markdown support built on top of Foundation's `AttributedString` markdown parser, but you can
plug in any format that can produce strings with [`PresentationIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/presentationintent)
attributes by conforming your parser to the `MarkupParser` protocol.

The built-in Markdown parser supports syntax extensions, like custom emoji. You can define emoji with
shortcodes that will be substituted after parsing:

```swift
let emoji: Set<Emoji> = [
  Emoji(
    shortcode: "rocket",
    url: URL(string: "https://example.com/rocket.png")!
  ),
  Emoji(
    shortcode: "sparkles",
    url: URL(string: "https://example.com/sparkles.gif")!
  ),
]

InlineText(
  markdown: "Shipped the new feature :rocket: and it's working :sparkles:",
  syntaxExtensions: [.emoji(emoji)]
)
```

Math expressions are also supported when you include `.math` in `syntaxExtensions`:

```swift
StructuredText(
  markdown: "The area is $A = \\pi r^2$.",
  syntaxExtensions: [.math]
)
```

### Text Selection

You can control whether users can select text within `InlineText` or `StructuredText` views with the
`textual.textSelection(_:)` modifier:

```swift
StructuredText(
  markdown: """
    ## The Problem
    ...
    """
)
.textual.textSelection(.enabled)
```

Scrollable regions like code blocks handle their own selection contexts. When you select text in a scrollable area,
any document-level selection clears automatically, and vice versa.

### Custom Text Effects

When the standard text attributes are not enough — a highlight behind a search match, a
hand-drawn underline, a cross-out — conform to `TextRunEffect` and draw the run yourself:

```swift
struct HighlightEffect: TextRunEffect {
  var color: Color

  func draw(_ run: Text.Layout.Run, in context: inout GraphicsContext) {
    context.fill(
      Path(roundedRect: run.typographicBounds.rect, cornerRadius: 3),
      with: .color(color)
    )
  }
}

InlineText(markdown: "This is **highlighted** text")
  .textual.inlineStyle(
    InlineStyle().strong(.bold, .textRunEffect(HighlightEffect(color: .yellow)))
  )
```

Textual draws a fragment in three passes: every `.behind` effect, then all of the text, then
every `.inFront` effect. Pass `placement: .inFront` for effects that belong over the glyphs:

```swift
InlineStyle().strikethrough(.textRunEffect(CrossOutEffect(color: .red), placement: .inFront))
```

To decorate ranges that do not correspond to a markup span — search results, for example — set
the attribute on the attributed string instead:

```swift
attributedString[range].textual.textRunEffect = AnyTextRunEffect(
  HighlightEffect(color: .yellow)
)
```

### Task Lists

A list item whose text starts with `[ ]`, `[x]`, or `[X]` renders as a checkbox, following
GitHub-flavored Markdown:

```swift
StructuredText(
  markdown: """
    - [x] Pick a date
    - [ ] Book the hotel
    """
)
```

Checkboxes are display only. Use the `textual.taskListMarker(_:)` modifier to change the symbols:

```swift
StructuredText(markdown: markdown)
  .textual.taskListMarker(
    .checkbox(incompleteSymbolName: "circle", completeSymbolName: "checkmark.circle.fill")
  )
```

### Offscreen Rendering

Code blocks are tokenized asynchronously so that scrolling stays smooth. Offscreen renderers —
`ImageRenderer`, PDF export, printing — draw before that work can finish, so code comes out
uncolored. Switch to synchronous highlighting for those cases:

```swift
StructuredText(markdown: markdown)
  .textual.syntaxHighlightingMode(.synchronous)
```

In this mode, code blocks are highlighted while the view body is evaluated, so the very first
drawn frame is already colored. Tokenization runs on the main actor, so keep the default
`.asynchronous` mode for content that is on screen.

### Styling

Textual provides a flexible styling system that lets you customize every aspect of structured text rendering. At the
highest level, you can apply a complete style preset with a single modifier. For finer control, you can override
individual block types or create fully custom styles.

#### Built-in Styles

Textual includes two complete style presets: `.default` and `.gitHub`. Apply them using the
`textual.structuredTextStyle(_:)` modifier:

```swift
StructuredText(
  markdown: """
    ## The Problem
    ...
    """
)
.textual.structuredTextStyle(.gitHub)
```

This single modifier configures the entire rendering stack: inline styles (code, emphasis, strong, links), block styles
(headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, code blocks, tables), and list markers.

#### Customizing Individual Elements

You can override specific aspects of a style without rebuilding everything. Each block type has its own modifier:

```swift
StructuredText(markdown: content)
  .textual.structuredTextStyle(.gitHub)
  .textual.headingStyle(
    CustomHeadingStyle()
  )
  .textual.codeBlockStyle(
    CustomCodeBlockStyle()
  )
```

Here's a practical example, a custom heading style that adds a subtle underline to H1:

```swift
struct CustomHeadingStyle: StructuredText.HeadingStyle {
  private static let fontScales: [CGFloat] = [2, 1.5, 1.25, 1, 0.875, 0.85]
  
  func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
    let headingLevel = min(configuration.headingLevel, 6)
    let fontScale = Self.fontScales[headingLevel - 1]
    
    VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 0) {
      configuration.label
        .textual.fontScale(fontScale)
        .fontWeight(.semibold)

      if headingLevel == 1 {
        Divider()
          .textual.padding(.top, .fontScaled(0.25))
      }
    }
    .textual.blockSpacing(.fontScaled(top: 1.5, bottom: 0.5))
  }
}
```

The configuration provides the rendered label and context like heading level and indentation, which you can use to
build custom layouts and apply additional styling.

#### Font-Relative Measurements

Notice the `.fontScaled()` values in the example above. Textual's font-relative measurement system ensures your layouts
scale harmoniously with text size:

```swift
.textual.padding(.fontScaled(1.0))
.textual.blockSpacing(.fontScaled(top: 0.8, bottom: 1.2))
```

These measurements adapt automatically to the current font size, dynamic type settings, and accessibility preferences.
A padding of `.fontScaled(0.5)` creates padding that is half of the current font size. As users adjust text size, your
spacing scales proportionally.

You may have noticed the `.textual` prefix on modifiers throughout these examples. Textual organizes its view modifiers
under this namespace, making them easy to discover through autocomplete while avoiding potential naming conflicts with
SwiftUI or other libraries. When you type `.textual`, you see only Textual-specific capabilities.

Many modifiers in the `.textual` namespace accept font-relative measurements through `.fontScaled()` values. Beyond
padding and spacing, you can use these measurements for frame sizes, insets, and any numeric value where scaling with
text size makes sense.

#### Complete Custom Styles

For full control, implement the `StructuredText.Style` protocol. This lets you define every aspect of rendering in one
cohesive theme:

```swift
struct CompactStyle: StructuredText.Style {
  var inlineStyle: InlineStyle {
    InlineStyle()
      .code(.monospaced, .fontScale(0.9))
      .strong(.fontWeight(.semibold))
  }

  var headingStyle: some StructuredText.HeadingStyle {
    CompactHeadingStyle()
  }

  var paragraphStyle: some StructuredText.ParagraphStyle {
    CompactParagraphStyle()
  }

  // ... other block styles

  var unorderedListMarker: StructuredText.UnorderedListMarker {
    .hierarchical(.disc, .circle, .square)
  }

  var orderedListMarker: StructuredText.OrderedListMarker {
    .decimal
  }
}

// Then apply it:
StructuredText(markdown: content)
  .textual.structuredTextStyle(CompactStyle())
```

The protocol requires implementations for all block types, list markers, and inline styles. This ensures visual
consistency across your entire document.

## Demos
